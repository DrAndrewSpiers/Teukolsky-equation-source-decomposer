# Teukolsky-equation-source-decomposer

Notebook for decomposing the source of the Teukolsky equation analytically. The notebook sets up the Held formalism.

The specific parts of this notebook which were adapted from "The N.P. and G.H.P. formalisms." are the "Newman Penrose Formalism" (apart from the Teukolsky derivation sections) and "GHP Formalism" chapters in the "Set up Notebook" section. The rest of this notebook was created by the author, Andrew Spiers.

Teukolsky-equation-source-decomposer.nb provides an example for decomposing the source of the Teukolsky equation using the half-Held formalism.
Held-formalism.nb is provided for those interested in the full Held formalism. They are both only consistent in the Kinnersley tetrad.
